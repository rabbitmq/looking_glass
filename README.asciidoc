= Looking Glass

Looking Glass is a tracer and profiler for Erlang/OTP.

== Goals

Looking Glass is the next generation profiling tool. It
is implemented as an `erl_tracer` NIF and thus requires
Erlang/OTP 19.0 or above.

Looking Glass aims to provide a very efficient tool
usable both in development and production settings,
and capable of running for a very long amount of time
even on busy systems.
